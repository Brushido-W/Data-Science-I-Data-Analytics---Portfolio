# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of Machine Learning Projects that I have created. Each project focuses on different aspects of Machine Learning with python and showcases various concepts and functionalities.

## Projects

1. **Sentiment Analysis using Neural Networks**

This Project focuses on implementing a basic form of Natural Language Processing (NLP) known as Sentiment Analysis. The objective is to develop two distinct neural networks using Keras to classify book reviews as either positive or negative.


2. **Using Keras to Build and Train Recurrent Neural Networks**

   Develop a LSTM network in Keras to solve a time-series prediction problem for International Airline Passengers. Predict the number of passengers (in units of 1,000) for the next month based on the current month's data.

3. **Recognizing CIFAR-10 images with Deep Learning**

   This project implements the popular Snake Game using Python and the Pygame library. Players control a snake that grows in length by consuming food while avoiding collisions with walls or its own body. To 
   control the snake the comands W,A,S and D are used.
