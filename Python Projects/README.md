# Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python projects that I have created. Each project focuses on different aspects of Python programming and showcases various concepts and functionalities.

## Projects

1. **Password Strength Checker**

   This project is a password strength checker that evaluates the strength of a given password based on predefined criteria. 
   The function checks for the following password requirements:
   - Length should be at least 8 characters.
   - Should contain at least one uppercase letter.
   - Should contain at least one lowercase letter.
   - Should contain at least one digit.
   - Should contain at least one special character.

   Based on these criteria, the function categorizes the password into one of four strength levels: 'Weak', 'Moderate', 'Strong', or 'Very Strong'.

2. **Hangman Game**

   The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game. Players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. The game requests you to pick a category to make the 
   experience more enjoyable and if you guess the wrong letter 6 times you lose!


3. **Snake Game**

   This project implements the popular Snake Game using Python and the Pygame library. Players control a snake that grows in length by consuming food while avoiding collisions with walls or its own body. To 
   control the snake the comands W,A,S and D are used.


4. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game (clickable)**

   The Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a two-player game where players take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid. This version of the game features a graphical user interface (GUI) with clickable buttons for player 
   interaction.
