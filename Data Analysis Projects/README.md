# Data Analysis Projects (Jupyter Notebooks)
This repository contains a collection of Data Analysis Projects that I have created. Each project focuses on different aspects of Python programming and showcases various concepts and functionalities.

## Projects

1. **2018 World Cup Analysis**

   In this project, I did an in-depth analysis and visualization on the FIFA18 dataset. The dataset is collected at this. The goal is to predict the best possible international squad lineups for these 10 teams: France, Germany, Spain, England, Brazil, Argentina, Belgium, Portugal, Uruguay, and Croatia at the 2018 World Cup this summer in Russia. The dataset contains all the statistics and playing attributes of all the players in the Full version of FIFA 18.

  ## Dataset also includes

 - Every player featuring in FIFA 18
 - 70+ attributes 
 - Player and Flag Images
 - Playing Position Data
 - Attributes based on actual data of the latest  EA's FIFA 18 game
 - Attributes include on all player style statistics like Dribbling, Aggression, GK Skills etc.
 - Player personal data like Nationality, Photo, Club, Age, Wage, Salary etc.


2. **Cars Anlayis**

   - This folder contains 2 different analysis from a car dataset. One Jupyter file analyzes data from a CSV file, while the other focuses on data from a text file. These files provide insights and visualizations to better understand and interpret the respective datasets related to cars.

   **Cars Data1 (CSV File)**

   This Jupyter file, named "EDA on Cars Data" is dedicated to the in-depth analysis of car data stored in a CSV format. The dataset contains comprehensive information about various car attributes, such as make, model, year, fuel efficiency, horsepower, and more. By leveraging pandas and data visualization libraries, this analysis aims to uncover valuable insights about the cars, including trends, correlations, and distributions among the different features. The file provides detailed charts, graphs, and statistical summaries to facilitate a deeper understanding of the dataset, enabling data-driven decision-making and valuable conclusions in the context of the automotive industry.

   **Automobile (Text File)**

   The second Jupyter file, titled "EDA on Automobile" delves into the analysis of car data stored in a text file format. The dataset comprises information about various car models, including their specifications, pricing, safety ratings, and performance metrics. Leveraging Python's powerful data manipulation and analysis libraries, this investigation aims to extract meaningful insights from the text data. The file employs techniques such as text parsing, data cleaning, and feature extraction to gain valuable information about the automobiles. The analysis provides descriptive statistics, visualizations, and informative summaries to offer a comprehensive view of the car dataset, aiding researchers, enthusiasts, and industry professionals in making informed decisions and understanding the characteristics of different car models.


3. **Medicine Analysis**

   This Jupyter notebook focuses on the thorough analysis of the "Database of Medicine Prices" in a CSV file format dated 05 May 2018. The dataset contains comprehensive information about medicine prices, including drug names, dosage forms, manufacturers, prices, and other relevant attributes. By utilizing pandas and data visualization libraries, this analysis aims to gain valuable insights into medicine pricing trends, regional variations, and comparisons among different medications. Through interactive charts, graphs, and statistical summaries, the Jupyter notebook provides a detailed exploration of the medicine price dataset, helping researchers, healthcare professionals, and policymakers to understand and interpret the dynamics of medicine pricing for informed decision-making and effective healthcare management.


4. **Titanic Analysis**

   In this Jupyter notebook, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the famous "Titanic" dataset in CSV format. The dataset provides information about the passengers onboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic, including their personal details, ticket information, cabin classes, survival status, and more.
Using popular data manipulation and analysis libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, we explore and visualize various aspects of the dataset. Our analysis aims to uncover insights into factors that influenced passenger survival, such as age, gender, ticket class, and family relationships.

   Through data visualizations, statistical summaries, and machine learning techniques, we delve deeper into the patterns and correlations present in the Titanic dataset. The Jupyter notebook serves as an informative resource for understanding the 
demographics and characteristics of the passengers, as well as the key factors that played a role in determining survival rates during that tragic event.


4. **Wine Analysis**

   This Jupyter notebook explores the "Wine" dataset in CSV format, providing insights into the attributes and quality ratings of various wines. Utilizing pandas, numpy, and seaborn, the analysis uncovers correlations between wine properties and ratings, helping enthusiasts and researchers better understand the factors that contribute to wine quality. Valuable for wine selection and appreciation.
